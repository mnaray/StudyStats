:::note
This is the documentation of the project. It has been implemented using IPERKA. It documents the process and approach of the entire project.

In this project, we are creating a small React Native multiplatform app. StudyStats allows users to track and manage their grades to have an overview of their academic performance. Our focus is on working with React Native.

:::

## Inform

This section of the documentation captures the phase in which we gather all necessary information. This includes requirements and the listing of [**all used sources**](#sources).

### Understanding React Native

React Native is an open-source framework that enables developers to create mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React. React Native uses the same React syntax used for web applications to build user interfaces. The significant advantage is that developers can write cross-platform mobile apps with React Native, sharing the majority of the code between different platforms.

### Our Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a simple, functional grade management app. Our focus is on creating a **multiplatform** app.

This project aims to deepen our knowledge in Module 335: Mobile Application Realization and prepare for the upcoming evaluation.
